//////    Axiom 1
//////Probability is backdated measure in sociology.Sanjoy Nath's qhenomenology reasoning system starts with assumption that all vocabulary words are just meaningless cpp classnames and the ordering of these vocabulary words dependent upon compilability ordering.this means while writing the dictionary you cannot use any word in right side (description side column 2) until all these words in description are well defined previously before that word is definitely defined before (in any previous row of same dictionary) . right side description is constructor of CPP class where left side column contains class names.This implies say any word at row r column 1 is described in row r column 2 and all word tokens (words used in column 2 are ensuried to present in any row<r column 1 of that same dictionary.untill column 1 row<r of dictionary contains a word w_i where I<r we cannot use w_i in right side column 2 in r th row. This strict condition is unique reasoning basis in Sanjoy Nath 's qhenomenology reasoning system.Ordering of basis objects and dependent objects are constructed following CPP compilability ordering.all vocabulary words are just unique Class names and are all uniquely QUEUED in column 1 of dictionary and exhaustive such queuedness describe the reasoning system of whole society. Regular use vocabulary, regular used queuedness of such concepts as CPP class descrbes the individual and society.This way CPP strictly ordered definition of classes compilability prooves meaningfulness. If the ordering alters, CPP project turns to non compilable.non compilability implies fallacy.noncompilability imples meaninglessness.strict QUEUED ness of vocabulary words (as concepts) are followed such that whole CPP project(dictionary or story or tender documents or legal documents are compilability check able)
//////Axiom 2
//////Sanjoy Nath 's Qhenomenology reasoning system takes awareness_ratio,attentiveness_ratio and sentitivity ratio as the alrernative measures which are more powerful predictability metric than probability
//////Take all population data(population of agents in a society) indexed and stored in rows of column 1 of a spreadsheet and all dictionary words(as qhenomenologically ordered queued in n rows of dictionary database column number 1 ) are now transposed and copied to analysis spreadsheet and pasted to row 1 n columns following ordering rules of axiom 1 (the axiom 1 rows of column 1 is now transposed to row 1 ,n columns for qhenomenology reasoning analysis spreadsheet.
//////Now we check how many individuals in society are aware about which concepts (listed in row 1 , n columns of qhenomenology reasoning analysis spreadsheet).same style is used for design of weightage calculation metrics for awareness,attentiveness, sensitivity like measurement over society and these distribution are used to predict society structure.
//////Axiom 3
//////All assumption or tautology are ignored and strict definitely defined words, concepts are used following axiom 1.all documents, all stories, all essays, all poems...are ordered following axiom 1 first.(If any supplied database for Qhenomenologically ordered dictionary terms or lookup table are not supplied then all the definitions are to supply in the text, all the tautology are necessary to supply in the text here in the content

//UNTIL THE BOOLEAN LOGIC FREGES LOGIC CANTORS LOGIC RUSSSELS LOGIC TYPE THEORY , SET THEORY WAS THERE IT  WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO FORMALIZE THE COMPUTATION (THEORETICAL COMPUTATIONS)  . THE BIT (NO/YES) SYSTEMS AND THE BINARY NUMBER SYSTEMS ARE THE BASIS FOR THE ELECTRONIC WAYS TO DEFINE THE CONCEPTS OF COMPUTATIONS. THEN THE PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURES WERE DEFINED DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED. THEN KEYBOARD ASCII SYSTEMS WERE DESIGNED (FIRST DEFINED CONCRETIZATIONS OF ABSTRACT CONCEPTS TURNED INTO THE CLARITY TO TEAM MEMBERS OF THE WHOLE PROCESS (THAT IS SOCIAL AWARENESS OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO PROCEED TO NEXT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND NEXT STAGES OF CONCEPTS ARISE ONLY AFTER THE PREVIOUS BASIS CONCEPTS ARE CLEARED CONCRETIZED TO SOCIETY TO THE LEVEL OF REGULAR USES AND WHEN ALL MEMBERS IN TEAM/(SOCIETY AS TEAM) CONCRETIZED THE IDEA TO USABLE PRACTICALLY AND THEN NEXT LEVEL CONCEPTS GET PLATFORMS TO ARISE OTHERWISE NEXT LEVEL OF CONCEPTS DONT ARISE IN HUMANS MIND... THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCRETE QUEUEDNESS REASONING BASIS THAT SANJOY NATH CONSIDERS AS THE BASIS OF PRACTICAL REASONING AND NEURAL NETWORK IS SECONDARY OR ALMOST IRRELEVANT IN THIS REASONING PROCESS... THE STRICT ORDERLINESS STRICT COMPARABILITY STRICT RECURSIVE STAGE WISE CONCRETIZATIONS STRICT QUEUEDNESS OF CONCEPT CONCRETIZATION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS FOR SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY REASONING SYSTEM WHERE TOPOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF CONCEPTS IS ALSO NECESSARY SO NUMBERING OF THE CONCEPTS AND QUEUEDNES OF EVERY WORDS(AS C++ CLASS ALL OF WHICH ARE CONCRETE CLASS NO ABSTRACT CLASS IS ALLOWED SINCE CONCRETIZED CONCEPTS ARE USED FOR NEXT LEVEL CONCEPTS AND WHEREVER NON CONCRETE CONCEPTS ARE INTRODUCED TO USE THAT ... IT IS TO MANIPILATE THE SYSTEM SO SANJOY NATH TRIES TO DESIGN THE QHENOMENOLOGY REASONING SYSTEM SUCH THAT NO HUMAN CAN DO ANY KIND OF MANIPULATIONS WHILE DOING REASONING)  THIS REASONING SYSTEM TAKES CARE FOR ALL HUMANS WORDS AND THEN PROCEED TO NEXT WORD... UNTIL THE CONCEPT OF GOD IS CONCRETIZED NO ONE CAN CONCRETIZE THE CONCEPT CHURCH...C FOR CHURCH AND G FOR GOD SO GOD COMES FIRST CHURCH COMES AFTER THAT... WHOLE DICTIONARY NEEDS TO REVISE ITS QUEUEDNESS AS PER QHENOMENOLOGY REASONING SYSTEMS... ALL HUMANS REASONING ARE MANIPULATED REASONING SYSTEMS AND HUMANS INVOLVE EMOTIONS AND DO BIASED REASONING...

//////    Axiom wise talks in Qhenomenology reasoning system
//////    Proposition Example "Conscuousness" is Just an english word Its Just a cpp class name which if compiles means prooves its existence.if any class dont compile then that class dont exist yet now we will try to check can we have compilability for consciousness class?
//////    What other classes are necessary to define consciousness class? Consciousness class constructor obviously use some instances of other classes(those other classes are more independent classes than consciousness class) untill those more independent classes are completely COMPILED we cannot create their instance variables inside constructor of consciousness class. Same system of checking necessary for all dictionary words in qhenomenology reasoning system.
//////   Axiom All human emotions are also just cpp class name They dont have any meaning
//////   Axiom Dictionary has no words All words are just cpp class names Some class compiles first before other classes and more independent classes compile before.more dependent classes compilable later.this compilability ordering governs dictionary order.alphabetical ordering not allowed
//////   Axiom Whichever class is more independent compiles before and dictionary orders are created as per independent class names come before dependent class names in dictionary
//////   Axiom Every cpp class in this system can have overridable main method and these are strict not static . None of members in these classes are allowed to have static members.All the members in every classes are non static.
//////Axiom
//////Humans interventions cannot enforce compilability.Compilers follow strict grammars and dont bother humans intentions but consistency from base class to current class governs strength of bias free fallacy free ambiguity free reasoning so reasoning consistency areverified.at each  stage of classdefinitions.Compilability itself is the proof of meaningfulness in Sanjoy Nath's qhenomenology reasoning system.

//fourier tried to explain the different wave forms as vertical summation of amplitudes (superposition of multiple sinusoidal shapes) and due to that superpositions the cycles natures of waves changes.  And when superpositions are done the waves (each cycles ) shapes changes and also the timeperiod (in microseconds) per shape cycle changes similarly the wave forms crest counts changes wave forms trough counts changes and ultimately we see one wave cycle has several crest and troughs involve to form single wave cycles... In conventional theory of waves frequency is described as the number of complete cycles per second(1000000 microsecond as width of a second along timelines)  Fourier used to look at the complete cycle (zero crossing points as effect of superposition) But Sanjoy Nath looks at frequency as combinatorial packing factor of different AABB widths along the timeline. So in Sanjoy Nath's interprretation (not taking vertical superposition as cause of zero crossing instead considering zero crossing are the combinatorial counting property and CATALAN NUMBERS , Integer partitioning like reasoning over timeline is used which means whole wave cycles are partitioned as CREST AABB WIDTH in microseconds and TROUGH AABB Widths in microseconds ultimately whole wavecycle is summation of well partitioned different sized AABB objects and total energy in a wave form depends upon CG of all amplitudes in the all AABB objects of crest and Trough objects which governs the waves features energy is scalar and scalarly addable so pure arithmetic is applicable and total cycle width in microsecond is time period of wave which is same in Sanjoy Nath's Qhenomenology linear queue model of crests and troughs but combinatorial juxtapositions of crest AABB Trough AABB can also achieve same time period but wave cycle will not look like complete wave cycle but when stacked with left margins aligned for all these AABB objects will not hamper the CG positioningcycle  )  Different Crest AABB Widths +6 Different Trough AABB Widths summed togather to form single wave cycle and that is TimePeriod of wave (as in conventional Theory of waves where superimposition of different sinusoidal components governs zero crossing points... Sanjoy Nath looks at these scanario from other point of view where Sanjoy Nath Takes zero crossing points as governing factors and Combinatorial clustering of Crest AABB Trough AABB and arranging these in specific strict ORDERED QUEUE OF particular CRESTS after PARTICULAR Troughs make a wave cycle and one time period is found  but TOPOLOGICALLY  that dont help us to think different kinds of QUEUING nor gives us bigger pictures of combinatorial packing problems of different sized AABB to achieve same cycle (Complete cycle of same Time Period) . On the other hand conventional theory of waves consider 1 second(1000000 micro second as reference) and number of complete time periods per second as frequency .  In the conventional theory of waves it is considered that certain cycle shape is rolling on a horizontal surface and when one complete cycle complets then certain distance is covered per cycle but while plotting the waves and whole showing the wave lengths the conventional theory of waves show wave lengths along the time axis. Sanjoy Nath considers total wave lengths as total time covered per cycle so time period and wave lengths look geometrically same in Sanjoy Nath's Qhenomenology Theory of Waves. So number of complete widths of complete cycle (after queuing of Crests AABB Trough AABB the full cycle completes and total time period covered as T microseconds which is a PACKET OF sOME AABB objects) When T squizes then packing count increases which is actually frequency increases... Frequency is nothing but the packing factor of complete AABB of a complete cycle in 1000000 micro seconds length. When frequency is packing factor then it is a scale facor of widths. When scale factor s is involved that scales the x coordinates of all CG points ) So when single cycles AABB gets squized the frequency increases so X coordinate of CG of Whole cycle AABB also squizes and so proportionately x coordinates of all component Crest AABB  and Trough AABB also squizes...) This way packing and partitioning of AABB Queue along time lines take different packing to form multi frequency waves. This justifies the horizontal AABB packing with conventional superimposition of waves(which are done vertically) Now consider the vertical sides that is Y values of CG for every AABB components... These vary due to frequency change and when the energy per CREST AABB and Energy per Trough AABB remains same horizontal squizing of AABB increases the Y values of CG (virtual bult modulus of these AABB to consider) So while stacking one AABB above another keeping left margins aligned will generate different y for differently squized x so vertical spectral lines are seen when we see the stacks of AABB from top views. This prooves the Justifications of conventional theory with Sanjoy Nath's Qhenomenological Theory of Waves

// AXIOM 3 SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY (Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing) PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS CONSIDERS WAVES AS SERIES(STRICT QUEUES OF CREST AABB OBJECTS AND TROUGH AABB OBJECTS ) ALL THESE CREST AND TROUGH  AABB OBJECTS ARE TRANSPARENT TRACING PAPERS LIKE AABBR RECTANGLES BOUNDING BOXES WHICH ALL HAVE SOME CENTER OF GRAVITY CALCULATED FROM THE POINTS OF AMPLITUDE TIPS BOUNDED INSIDE THESE CREST AND TROUGH  AABB LIKE TRANSPARENT TRACING PAPER LIKE OBJECTS) FOR CREST OBJECTS THE ORIGIN OF AABB RECTANGULAR BOUNDING BOXES ARE AT LEFT BOTTOM CORNER OF THE RECTANGULAR BOUNDING BOXES AND FOR TROUGH LIKE OBJECTS THE ORIGIN IS AT LEFT TOP CORNER OF AABB RECTANGLE BOUNDING BOXES AND THESE ORIGINS ARE PLACED ON THE 0 0 (AVERAGE AMPLITUDE LINE ) SUCH THAT QUEUE LIKE SEQUENCE OF CREST TROUGH CREST TROUGH ARE PLACED ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERY CREST OBJECT HAS A STRICT SEQUENCE NUMBER AND EVERY TROUGH HAS STRICT SEQUENCE NUMBER SO EVERY CREST AND TROUGH ARE UNIQUELY PLACED IN THE STRICT QUEUE TO GENERATE THE WHOLE WAVE OBJECT(WHOLE SIGNAL OBJECT)
// AXIOM 3+ SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY (Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing) PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS  THE ANALYSIS STARTS WITH THE CONDITION THAT FORGET THE ACTUAL AMPLITUDES VALUES AND REMEMBERS ONLY THE MAX WIDTH OF EACH AABB (IN MICROSECONDS OR LIKE THAT MEASURE OR  METRIK)  , MAX HEIGHT OF EACH AABB(OR AMPLITUDE LIKE MEASURES METRIKS) CG , STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF AMPLITUDES , SKEWNESS OF AMPLITUDES , KURTOSIS OF AMPLITUDES IN THESTATISTICAL  MOMENTS CALCULATED ON THE AMPLITUDES IN THE CREST AABB OBJECT OR IN THE TROUGH AABB OBJECTS ... THE ACTUAL AMPLITUDE VALUES ARE FORGOTTEN ENTIRELY WHILE DOING SIGNALS PROPERTY ANALYSIS)
// AXIOM 3++ SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY(Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing)  PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS THE ANALYSIS IS DONE ON THE STACKS (DISMANTLED QUEUE OF CREST AABB AND TROUGH AABB AND THE QUEUE OBJECT IS TRANSFORMED TO (0,0) ALIGNED (LEFT MARGIN ALIGNED) AABB RECTANGLES BOUNDING BOXES SUCH THAT THE (AFTER DISMANTLED QUEUE AND STACKING DONE)STACK OF TRANSPARENT CREST BOUNDING BOXES AND TROUGH BOUNDING BOXES ARE PLACED IN STACK ALL THE LEFT MARGINS ARE ALIGNED AS OVERALL LEFT MARGINS (SANJOY NATH HAS TESTED ON 380000 SOUND WAV FILES DIGITAL WAV FILES) AND FOUND THAT CG (BLUE DOTS FOR CREST AABB AMPLITUDES) AND RED DOTS FOR CG ON THE TROUGH AABB AMPLITUDES) LIE ON THE VERTICAL LINES OF SPECTRUMS LIKE VERTICAL STRIPS WHEN ALL THESE TRANSPARENT RECTANGLES AABB  BOUNDING BOXES (LEFT MARGIN ALIGNED ORIGINS OF ALL AABB RECTANGULAR TRACING PAPERS  PLACED ON ORIGINS OF OTHERS SO THAT ALL ORIGINS ARE PLACED ON SAME LOCATION IN STACK) ARE SHOWING THAT IF THERE ARE N DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES PRESENT IN THE WAVE THEN THERE ARE N SHARP VERTICAL LINES ARE THERE IF WE LOOK AT THE STACK OF TRANSPARENT ALIGNED AABB OBJECTS WHICH SIGNIFIES THE FREQUENCY ANALYSIS IS EASIER TO HANDLE AND NO NEED OF FFT LIKE DATA HANDLING NECESSARY AT ALL NO NEED TO COS COMPONENTS NO NEED OF SIN COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO DO SPECTRAL ANALYSIS ON TEH WAVES LIKE OBJECTS.
// AXIOM 7   SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY(Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing)  PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS HAS FOUND THAT(ON TESTING ON 380000 WAV FILES)     THE TERMS LIKE WAVE LENGTH IS NOT NECESSARY TO ANALYSE WAVE LIKE DIGITAL SIGNALS THE TERMS LIKE FREQUENCY ARE NOT NECESSARY TO HANDLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSINGS NOR WE NEED THE COS COMPONENTS TO DESCRIBE WAVE LIKE DATA NOR WE NEED SIN COMPONENTS LIKE OBJECTS TO DESCRIBE WAVE OR DIGITAL SIGNAL LIKE DATA (THE QUEUE OF AABB RECTANGLES BEHAVE AS WAVE NATURE OF THE LIGHT AND STACKS OF SAME AABB RECTANGLES  BEHAVE AS THE PARTICLE NATURE OF LIGHT AND SPECTRAL NATURE OF LIGHTS ARE NOTHING BUT THE ALIGNMENTS OF CG OF THESE AABB OBJECTS STACKED AND OBSERVED FROM TOP VIEWS) SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGICAL REASONING ON THEORY OF WAVE IS COMPLETELY IGNORING THE TERMS LIKE FREQUENCY TERMS LIKE WAVE LENGTHS AND TREATS WAVES AS QUEUE OF AABB OBJECTS OR STACKS OF AABB OBJECTS
// AXIOM 6 SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY(Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing)  PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS       HAVE SEEN THAT IF THE CREST AABB BOXES HAS WIDTHS (IN MICRO SECONDS TAKEN) HAS W_C_1 , W_C_2 ... W_C_N   AND THE WITHS IN MICROSECONDS FOR TROUGHS OBJECTS AS W_T_1 , W_T_2 ... W_T_N  (TOTAL NUMBER OF CRESTS AND TOTAL NUMBER OF TROUGHS ARE NOT NECESSARILY SAME BECAUSE SOMETIMES THERE ARE JUST ZERO TOUCHING CRESTS AND JUST ZERO TOUCHING TROUGHS ARE THERE STILL THE PROPERTIES HOLDS) AFTER OBSERVING THE STACKS OF TRANSPARENT AABB OBJECTS ...... THE OBSERVATIONS ON 380000 WAVE FILES STUDY REVEALS THAT  WHEN FREQUENCY OF SAME SOUND (TONE) INCREASES THE WIDTHS SQUIZES AND WHEN THE FREQUENCY OF SAME SOUND (TONE) DECREASES  THEN THE WIDTHS OF CREST TROUGH INCREASES SO THE NUMBER OF CRESTS PER SECOND(1000000 MICROSECOND) CHANGES AS THE FREQUENCY (TONE) OF THE SOUND CHANGES AND NUMBER OF SHARP VERTICAL LINES (FORMED DUE TO ALIGNMENT OF SUCH MARKED  CG POINTS)VISIBLE ON STACK OF TRANSPARENT AABB  OF CREST OBJECTS AND TROUGH OBJECTS ULTIMATELY GIVES CLARITY OF NUMBER OF FREQUENCIES INVOLVED IN THE WAVE (SPECTRAL ANALYSIS IS EASY) SINCE ALL TEH CREST AND TROUGHS HAVE QUEUE_SERIAL_NUMBERS SO WE CAN RE ARRANGE THE STACK TO QUEUE AGAIN AFTER THE ANALYSIS IS DONE
// AXIOM 8  SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY (Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing) PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS  WE PRESERVE THESE OVERALL_AABB_COUNTER_EITHER_IT_IS_CREST_OR_IT_IS_TROUGH____COUNTER_TO_RECONSTRUCTION_THE_ACTUAL_QUEUE_STRUCTURE_FROM_THE_STACK_ANALYSIS_DATA  BEFORE STACKING DONE FROM THE QUEUE STRUCTURE AND WE CAN ALSO ALTER THE WHOLE SIGNAL TO RECONSTRUCT RANDOM VALUES OF AMPLITUDES FOR CREST AABB FOR TROUGH AABB PRESERVING THE GEOMETRY OF CG POINTS AS THESE ARE AND THESE KIND OF RECONSTRUCTIONS OF WAVES WITH COMPLETELY OTHER SETS OF AMPLITUDES WILL GENERATE SAME SPECTRAL BEHAVIORS AS THE ACTUAL WAVE OBJECTS THIS IS INTERESTING PROPERTY OF  SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS 
// AXIOM 9   SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY (Dont confuse with Phenomenology , it is Qhenomenology which is entirely different thing) PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS  CONSIDERS ALL PHOTON LIKE THINGS ARE NOT EXISTING WHILE INSTEAD THE WAVES CRESTS AND TROUGHS QUE DISMATLES TO STACKS OF AABB (AS IN THE AXIOMS HERE)WHILE LIGHT PASS THROUGH SLITS OR WHILE LIGHT PASS THROUGH CRYSTALS THE CREST AABB QUEUES AND TROUGH AABB QUEUES CLOOAPSES (DISMANTLES) AND THE STACKS ARE FORMED AS PER SANJOY NATHS DESCRIPTIONS IN  SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS  SO WE GET THE SPECTRUMS OF CG ALIGNED WHICH WE MISTAKE AS FREQUENCY SPECTRUMS...  SANJOY NATH'S QHENOMENOLOGY PHYSICS REASONING SYSTEMS ON WAVES AND DIGITAL SIGNALS  CLAIMS THAT THESE ARE NOT AT ALL FREQUENCY SPECTRUMS BUT THESE ARE CG ALIGGNED ON STACKS OF AABB LOOKS LIKE VERTICAL LINE SPECTRUMS DUE TO STACKING OF CREST AABB STACKING OF TROUGH AABB OBJECTS
